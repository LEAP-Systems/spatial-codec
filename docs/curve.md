# Defining and using space-filling curves

## Background

In general, we can define an order (scanning order) of points in d-dimensional space as follows. We give a set of rules, each of which specifies (i) how to subdivide a region in d-dimensional space into subregions; (ii) what is the order of these subregions; and (iii) for each subregion, which rule is to be applied to establish the order within that subregion. We also specify a unit region, and we indicate what rule is used to subdivide and order it.

[Hausdorff Dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) describes a fractals dimension. It is also used to provide a precise metric of roughness. Space filling curves have the same Hausdorff Dimension as the space they fill due to satisfying the infinite bounds of the Hausdorff dimension. N = S<sup>D</sup> defines a shapes dimension where N is the number of copies created by each iteration, S is the scaling factor applied to each copy and D is the dimension of the shape.
