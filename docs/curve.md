# Defining and using space-filling curves

In general, we can define an order (scanning order) of points in d-dimensional space as follows. We give a set of rules, each of which specifies (i) how to subdivide a region in d-dimensional space into subregions; (ii) what is the order of these subregions; and (iii) for each subregion, which rule is to be applied to establish the order within that subregion. We also specify a unit region, and we indicate what rule is used to subdivide and order it.
