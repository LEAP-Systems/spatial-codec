# Defining and using space-filling curves
In general, we can define an order (scanning order) of points in d-dimensional space as follows. We give a set of rules, each of which specifies (i) how to subdivide a region in d-dimensional space into subregions; (ii) what is the order of these subregions; and (iii) for each subregion, which rule is to be applied to establish the order within that subregion. We also specify a unit region, and we indicate what rule is used to subdivide and order it.

## Iterators
Class A: (x,y,z) iterators
Class B: (x,y,z) iterators
Class C: (x,y,z) iterators
Class D: (x,y,z) iterators
Class E: (x,y,z) iterators
Class F: (x,y,z) iterators

 - x and -x are equal why??
## Degrees of Freedom
### Reflection
Reflection about xz plane: `(x,y,z) -> (x,-y,z)`
Reflection about xy plane: `(x,y,z) -> (x,y,-z)`
