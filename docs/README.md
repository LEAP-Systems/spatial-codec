## Background
[Hausdorff Dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) describes a fractals dimension. It is also used to provide a precise metric of roughness. Space filling curves have the same Hausdorff Dimension as the space they fill due to satisfying the infinite bounds of the Hausdorff dimension. N = S<sup>D</sup> defines a shapes dimension where N is the number of copies created by each iteration, S is the scaling factor applied to each copy and D is the dimension of the shape.
